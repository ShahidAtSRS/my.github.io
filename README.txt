Setting up Git repository for a test page on GitHub
=====================================================================================

To create a repository:
	1. Create an empty folder or switch to the folder that you want to make a repository
	2. In the terminal window, give init command: git init >> to initialize the folder as git repository

As changes are made, the README file gets filled in with details about design choices, installation instructions, notable files and their contents, etc. 
For example, we might begin with:

Files
	README 	this file
	tests 	testing files, in pairs of *.in, *.expected
================================================================

HTML-CSS practice files project
===============================

This directory contains HTML scafold, test index.html and other practice files. Here are more details:

Files

	README						This file
	graphics 					folder to keep image files separate
	index.html					some basic html elements  
  	
no test files yes

	test1.in					to be created
	test1.expected				to be created 

Another important file to be added: python script runtests.py to run tests
